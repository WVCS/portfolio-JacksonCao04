    Yeah, you got that yummy, yum 
That yummy, yum
That yummy, yummy
Yeah, you got that yummy, yum
That yummy, yum
That yummy, yummy
Say the word, on my way
Yeah babe, yeah babe, yeah babe
Any night, any day
Say the word, on my way
Yeah babe, yeah babe, yeah babe
In the morning or late
Say the word, on my way
Bonafide stallion
You ain't in no stable, no, you stay on the run
Ain't on the side, you're number one
Yeah, every time I come around, you get it done
Fifty-fifty, love the way you split it
Hunnid racks, help me spend it, babe
Light a match, get litty, babe
That jet set, watch the sunset kinda, yeah, yeah
Rollin' eyes back in my head, make my toes curl, yeah, yeah
Yeah, you got that yummy, yum
That yummy, yum
That yummy, yummy
Yeah, you got that yummy, yum
That yummy, yum
That yummy, yummy
Say the word, on my way
Yeah babe, yeah babe, yeah babe
Any night, any day
Say the word, on my way
Yeah babe, yeah babe, yeah babe
In the morning or late
Say the word, on my way
Standing up, keep me on the rise
Lost control of myself, I'm compromised
You're incriminated, no disguise
And you ain't never running low on supplies
Fifty-fifty, love the way you split it
Hunnid racks, help me spend it, babe
Light a match, get litty, babe
That jet set, watch the sunset kinda, yeah, yeah
Rollin' eyes back in my head, make my toes curl, yeah, yeah
Yeah, you got that yummy, yum
That yummy, yum
That yummy, yummy (and you stay flexing on me)
Yeah, you got that yummy, yum
That yummy, yum (yeah)
That yummy, yummy
Say the word, on my way
Yeah babe, yeah babe, yeah babe (yeah babe)
Any night, any day
Say the word, on my way
Yeah babe, yeah babe, yeah babe (yeah babe)
In the morning or late
Say the word, on my way
Hop in the Lambo, I'm on my way
Drew House slippers on with a smile on my face
I'm elated that you are my lady
You got the yum, yum, yum, yum
You got the yum, yum, yum, whoa
Whoa-ooh
Yeah, you got that yummy, yum
That yummy, yum
That yummy, yummy
Yeah, you got that yummy, yum
That yummy, yum
That yummy, yummy
Say the word, on my way
Yeah babe, yeah babe, yeah babe (yeah babe)
Any night, any day
Say the word, on my way
Yeah babe, yeah babe, yeah babe (yeah babe)
In the morning or late
Say the word, on my way </dd>

      <dd> <pre> Across the ocean, across the sea
Starting to forget the way you look at me now
Over the mountains, across the sky
Need to see your face, I need to look in your eyes
Through the storm and through the clouds
Bumps on the road and upside down now
I know it's hard, babe, to sleep at night
Don't you worry
'Cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Through the sorrow, and the fights
Don't you worry
'Cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
All alone, in my room
Waiting for your phone call to come soon
And for you, oh, I would walk a thousand miles
To be in your arms, holding my heart
Oh I
Oh I
I love you
And everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Through the long nights
And the bright lights
Don't you worry
'Cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
You know that I care for you
I'll always be there for you
I promise I will stay right here, yeah
I know that you want me too
Baby we can make it through anything
'Cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Through the sorrow, and the fights
Don't you worry
'Cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Through the sorrow, and the fights
Don't you worry
Everything's gonna be alright
